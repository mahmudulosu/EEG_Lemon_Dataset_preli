UCI EEG Eye State Classification (SVM + GridSearch + t-SNE)

This project trains a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier to predict eye state (open vs closed) from EEG features using the UCI “EEG Eye State” dataset (commonly distributed as eye_data.csv / EEG Eye State).

Dataset

Each row is one EEG sample.

14 input features (EEG-related numeric features).

1 target label: eye state (typically 0/1 where one value represents open and the other represents closed, depending on the dataset version).

Method

Shuffle the dataset.

Split into train / validation / test.

Normalize feature vectors (L2 normalization).

Train SVM with hyperparameter search:

C and gamma tuned using GridSearchCV.

Evaluate using:

Accuracy

Confusion matrix

Classification report

Visualize feature space using t-SNE (2D embedding) colored by label
