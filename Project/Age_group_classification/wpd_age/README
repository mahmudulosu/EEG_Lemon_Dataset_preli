Age Group Classification from Resting-State EEG (Eye-Open) using WPD + Subject-wise CV

This project predicts age group (Young vs Old) from resting-state EEG signals.
Participants are grouped using metadata into:

Young: 20–30 years

Old: 60–75 years

Pipeline

Load EEG CSV files (Eye-Open recordings).

Segment each EEG recording into fixed windows (e.g., 2s / 5s / 30s).

Artifact removal & normalization

Detrend each channel to remove baseline drift

Z-score normalize channel amplitudes

Wavelet Packet Decomposition (WPD) features

Wavelet: db4

Level: 5

For each channel and each level-5 node, compute:

Mean

RMS

Feature selection

ANOVA F-test (top 60% features)

Subject-wise 10-fold cross-validation

Ensures no participant appears in both train and test folds

Models

DNN (Keras)

SVM (linear)

Why subject-wise CV?

EEG segments from the same subject are highly correlated.
Subject-wise splitting prevents data leakage and provides a more realistic estimate of generalization.

How to run

Edit configuration at the top of the script:

SEGMENT_SECONDS = 2 / 5 / 30

MODEL_TYPE = "dnn" or "svm"
