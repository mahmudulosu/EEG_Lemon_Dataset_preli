Young vs Old Classification from Resting-State EEG (EO/EC)

This repository implements a complete pipeline to classify participants into young vs old age groups using resting-state EEG recordings and participant metadata.

Data

EEG signals are stored as CSV files in Common_Data/

File naming format is assumed like:
participantID_EO.csv and participantID_EC.csv

Metadata is read from participants_LSD_andLEMON.csv, using:

Age bins: 20-25, 25-30 → young

Age bins: 60-65, 65-70, 70-75 → old

Pipeline

Load EO and/or EC EEG recordings for subjects present in the metadata

Extract DWT (db4) features (mean, variance, RMS) from wavelet coefficients

Apply StandardScaler + ANOVA feature selection (top 60%)

Train and evaluate models:

Linear SVM

DNN (Keras)

Evaluation modes

Subject-level mode (recommended): one sample per subject created from both EO+EC (concatenated or merged)

Segment-level mode: segment EEG into fixed windows (e.g., 2 seconds) and evaluate using subject-wise splits (GroupKFold / GroupShuffleSplit) to avoid leakage.
