EEG EC vs EO Classification (Subject-wise) using Wavelet Packet Decomposition (WPD)

This project classifies resting-state EEG into:

EC: Eyes Closed

EO: Eyes Open

using Wavelet Packet Decomposition (WPD) feature extraction and multiple machine learning models.

Key idea: WPD features

Instead of using raw EEG or basic time-domain features, we apply Wavelet Packet Decomposition (db4, level=5) on every EEG channel.
WPD decomposes both approximation and detail components at each level (richer than standard DWT), producing more detailed time–frequency sub-bands.
From each WPD node we extract statistical features:

Mean

Variance

RMS

Kurtosis

Skewness

Subject-wise evaluation (no leakage)

EEG segments from the same participant are correlated.
To avoid data leakage, evaluation is performed using subject-wise K-fold cross-validation, where:

Train fold contains a set of subjects

Test fold contains different subjects (never seen in training)

Models compared

The same feature set is evaluated using:

DNN (Keras)

SVM (Linear)

Random Forest

Gradient Boosting

Dataset expectations

EEG data stored as .csv files in one folder.

Each filename must contain EC or EO to infer the label.

Subject ID is extracted from filename prefix before first underscore:

Example: S001_EC.csv → Subject=S001, Label=EC
