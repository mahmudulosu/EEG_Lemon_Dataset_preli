EEG Gender Classification (EC/EO) using Wavelet Features + ML/DL

This project predicts gender (Male/Female) from resting-state EEG recordings stored as CSV files.

Data layout

EEG signals are saved per subject in CSV format.

File names start with the subject ID (e.g., sub-001_EC.csv or sub-001_EO.csv).

Two conditions are supported:

EC = Eyes Closed

EO = Eyes Open

Participant metadata (participant_id, gender, etc.) is read from a separate CSV file.

Pipeline

Segmentation: each EEG recording is split into fixed windows (e.g., 2s or 5s at 250 Hz).

Feature extraction: Discrete Wavelet Transform (db4) is applied per EEG channel, then statistical features are computed from each wavelet coefficient set:

mean, variance, RMS

Preprocessing:

Standardization (z-score) using StandardScaler

Feature selection using ANOVA (SelectPercentile, typically top 60% features)

Models:

Linear SVM

Random Forest

Gradient Boosting

DNN (Keras)

Evaluation:

K-Fold cross-validation

Confusion matrix + classification report

Optional t-SNE visualization for selected participants

Important note about validation

If cross-validation is done on segments directly, segments from the same subject may appear in both train and test, which can inflate performance.

A stricter evaluation uses subject-wise split (Group/subject CV) so that no subject appears in both train and test folds.
