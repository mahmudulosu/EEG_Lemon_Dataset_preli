ubject Identification from EEG (Segment-level, within-session)

This project identifies the subject ID from resting-state EEG data stored as CSV files.

Method

Each EEG file is segmented into 2-second windows (250 Hz → 500 samples).

For each segment and each EEG channel, Discrete Wavelet Transform (db4) is applied and statistical features are extracted:

mean, variance, RMS of wavelet coefficients

Features are standardized (StandardScaler) and reduced using ANOVA feature selection (top 60%).

Multiple classifiers are trained and evaluated:

Linear SVM

Random Forest

Gradient Boosting

Deep Neural Network (Keras)

Output

Test accuracy

Confusion matrix and classification report (per subject)

Note
The dataset is split within each subject (segments from the same subject are present in both train and test). This measures within-session subject identification. For a stricter evaluation, a subject-wise split across sessions/runs is recommended.
