This code classifies EEG data into Eyes Closed (EC) vs Eyes Open (EO). EEG CSV recordings are segmented into 5-second windows, then wavelet features are extracted using DWT (db4, level 6). For each wavelet coefficient, statistical descriptors (mean, std, RMS, variance, skewness, kurtosis) are computed. Features are reduced using ANOVA (top 60%). The models (DNN, linear SVM, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) are evaluated using subject-wise 10-fold cross-validation, where one random EC and one random EO segment per subject are selected to reduce subject leakage.
✅ subject-wise selection (1 EC + 1 EO segment per subject if available) + ✅ DWT+stats features + ✅ ANOVA feature selection + ✅ 10-fold subject-wise CV for DNN, SVM, RF, GBM.
